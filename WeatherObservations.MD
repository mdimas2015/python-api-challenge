Weather Py Observable Trends

1. We can see that  the temperature decreases in the Northern Hemisphere and the farther north, the more the temperature gets colder.  Temperature increases toward the 70-90 range once closer towards the equator. The peak temperature is near equator.

2. Comparing humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, we can observe that there is no actual correlation.

3. By comparing the Latitude vs Max Temp and the Latitude vs Humidity charts; we can conclude a correlation between higher temperatures and higher % of humidity.
